/**
 * tk_hash_entry_t:
 *
 * A #tk_hash_entry_t contains both a key and a value for
 * #tk_hash_table_t. User-derived types for #tk_hash_entry_t must
 * be type-compatible with this structure (eg. they must have an
 * unsigned long as the first parameter. The easiest way to get this
 * is to use:
 *
 * 	typedef _my_entry {
 *	    tk_hash_entry_t base;
 *	    ... Remainder of key and value fields here ..
 *	} my_entry_t;
 *
 * which then allows a pointer to my_entry_t to be passed to any of
 * the #tk_hash_table_t functions as follows without requiring a cast:
 *
 *	_tk_hash_table_insert (hash_table, &my_entry->base);
 *
 * IMPORTANT: The caller is responsible for initializing
 * my_entry->base.hash with a hash code derived from the key. The
 * essential property of the hash code is that keys_equal must never
 * return %TRUE for two keys that have different hashes. The best hash
 * code will reduce the frequency of two keys with the same code for
 * which keys_equal returns %FALSE.
 *
 * Which parts of the entry make up the "key" and which part make up
 * the value are entirely up to the caller, (as determined by the
 * computation going into base.hash as well as the keys_equal
 * function). A few of the #tk_hash_table_t functions accept an entry
 * which will be used exclusively as a "key", (indicated by a
 * parameter name of key). In these cases, the value-related fields of
 * the entry need not be initialized if so desired.
